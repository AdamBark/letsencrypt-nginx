* letsencrypt-nginx

This is a simple docker container that expands on the official nginx container to include letsencrypt to generate certificates.


** Usage

Once the container is running you will likely want to run certbot to create your certificates and update the configuration of nginx; something like the following.

: docker exec -it "$container_name" certbot run

It is also advisable to set up a cron job on the host system to periodically renew the certificates.
